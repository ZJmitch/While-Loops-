#Problem 4 counter for a list until 50, divisible numbers by 10 printed

count = 0

while count <= 50:
    print(count)

    count += 1

if count % 10:
    print("Divisible by 10")


#Program prints numbers 1-50. If the number is divisible by 10 its supposed to print a message but I was only able to get it to print at the end instead of every number divisible by 10.
